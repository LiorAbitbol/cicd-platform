# cicd-platform

A production-inspired CI/CD platform project built to demonstrate
modern software delivery practices using GitHub Actions, AWS ECS/Fargate,
and Infrastructure as Code.

---

## Project Goals

- Build a realistic CI/CD platform from first principles
- Separate **confidence (CI)** from **risk (CD)**
- Avoid long-lived credentials using AWS OIDC
- Favor clarity, observability, and reproducibility over shortcuts

---

## Architecture Overview

High-level target architecture:

```
GitHub (Source)
  ↓
GitHub Actions (CI)
  - Lint
  - Tests
  - Docker build
  ↓
Artifact Registry (Amazon ECR)
  ↓
GitHub Actions (CD via OIDC)
  ↓
AWS ECS Fargate
  ↓
Application Load Balancer
```

## Current State

- [x] FastAPI application with health endpoint
- [x] Dockerized application
- [x] Dedicated AWS VPC with public subnets
- [x] ECS Fargate runtime behind an ALB
- [x] CI-only GitHub Actions workflow (lint, tests, docker build)
- [x] Local Docker development workflow
- [x] Operator-grade documentation (runbooks)

## Local Development

### Python (recommended)

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r app/requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
ruff check .
pytest -q
```

### Docker
